# Pure.sass

This is an attempt to port the great [Pure.css](http://http://purecss.io/) framework
 to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). I've just copied the original source files and
 replaced some properties with variables.

The goal is to have an easily customizable version of Pure.css which fit in the Sass workflow.

It produces results seemingly identical to the original source.

## How to use

Customize changing the value of the variables in `base/_variables.css` and compile.

## TODO

* More testing
* More variables
* Rewrite some files to fit the Sass approach
* Include normalize.css
* Build system based on Grunt or Gulp (or both)
