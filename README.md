# Pure.sass

This is my attempt to port the great [Pure.css](http://http://purecss.io/) framework
 to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). I've just copied the original source files and
 replaced some properties with variables.

The goal is to have an easily customizable version of Pure.css which fit in the Sass workflow.

This is experimental, use the real Pure.css if you want to have an awesome
look with a tiny framework in your site.

## TODO

* More testing
* More variables
* Rewrite some files to fit the Sass approach
* Include normalize.css
* Build system based on Grunt or Gulp (or both)
